 * A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:

 'A' -> 1
 'B' -> 2
 ...
 'Z' -> 26
 Given an encoded message containing digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.

 Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
 Example
 Given encoded message 12, it could be decoded as AB (1 2) or L (12).
 The number of ways decoding 12 is 2.
