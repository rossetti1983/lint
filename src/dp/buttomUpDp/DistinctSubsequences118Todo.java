 * Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of T in S.

 A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

 Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
 Example
 Given S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit", return 3.
